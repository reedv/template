* Common argument against desenting users and film critics is: "Well lets see what you've ever done?!" The implication beig that those critics have no right to actually be critical, since they don't know (and so, lack) the skill required to produce the thing that they are criticizing.
* I think this is a totally weak argument in most cases. You don't need to be a chef to ... Imagine if the US government took this stance and just told everyone "it has been decided that only past and present government officials are qualified to participate in government affairs, please return to your homes and stop bothering us about your needs" (though I'm sure there are some people who would love to say just that (for some interesting and some lame reasons)).
