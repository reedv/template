I took my first computer programming class in my first semester at a community college. Of course our first assignment was to implement the traditional 'hello world' statement. I'm embarrassed to admit, I thought I would be clever and use a loop to repeat it in French. However, I later found out that 'bienvenue world' is 'welcome world,' *not* 'hello world'; at least I learned that trying to be *clever* in your code is generally a bad idea. Looking back now, printing to the screen is such a small thing, but at the time it felt so cool to be able to sit down and essentially think something into a thing that could actually be seen and used, that part still feels cool.

I could not have imagined the hidden nightmares behind this new interest. When I missed the first major project deadline in that class due to my own impossible-to-debug spaghetti code, I became eager to learn about design; Spending free time to learn about things like judicious commenting/naming, sensibly isolating function responsibilities, using readable formatting, design patterns, etc.

There is still a lot more that I have to learn. I have started taking a software engineering class and it is so far looking to be a good opportunity to gain some valuable experiences. My goal for this class is to learn how to more effectively build projects that are useful and maintainable, and be able be able to take another step towards building better tools for people to use.
