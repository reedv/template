__Disclaimer__: This essay is my updated version of a tutorial called "building a virtualized 5-node HDP 2.0 cluster (all within a mac)" by Lester Martin which you can find (here)[https://martin.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/lestermartin/blog/2014/01/19/34832444/building+a+virtualized+5-node+HDP+2.0+cluster+all+within+a+mac#buildingavirtualized5-nodeHDP2.0cluster(allwithinamac)-RemainingNodes]. In attempting to follow it, there were several things that were either not explained fully enough for me to understand (having work little with VM manager at that point) or were no longer correct (as VirtualBox and/or Hadoop had been updated).
