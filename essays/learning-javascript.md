__On Javascript__

I recently started learning Javascript for a software engineering class and, coming from C++ being my first language, there are a lot of things that come as a welcomed change. I'm just going to list everything I like about the language so far.

1. Its a scripting language, so you can quickly do tests and experiments with it (in this case, from the Node.js environment).
2. Objects in Javascript more closely resemble key-value lists, rather than a C-like object with predefined fields and methods, so attributes can be added or removed at runtime as needed. This all works as expected because...
3. Functions as first class objects, so once you define a function, you can pass it around like any other variable (such as adding it to an object's list of attributes).
4. Arrays have no type restrictions, so there is less getting in the way of you making the kind of data structure you want to make.
5. Partial functions (function currying). Being able to partially apply a function's parameters (as well as nested functions) makes it easier to build larger and more flexible functions.
6. Javascript's loose typing makes it easy to build things on the fly, only when you need them, without having to first define some class or struct.
7. Lastly, generally every device has a web browser available. This makes it easy for Javascript projects to be built anywhere.

Overall, its just easier to more directly write what you want to make or have happen in a way more closely resembling the way a human would think of it (and thus easier for other humans to work with), rather than having to deal with the details of how a computer is going to have to work with your data.

__On Athletic Software Engineering__

The class also uses a learning style called athletic software engineering, a style of learning inspired by hackathon coding jams and cross-fit training that emphasizes consistent bursts of exercises designed to create a sense of urgency and train for a startup weekend environment. Having the opportunity to acclimate yourself to short deadlines and creating artificial pressure at 'safe' times is a benefit in itself, in my mind, and the athletic style also simulates a low-stakes exam-like environment, which has been shown to improve learning and retention. The athletic style also includes some thoughtful elements of gamification which I know, as someone who plays video games often, is a great motivational trick. So far, I am excited to see what can be made of this new learning style and, in any case, am glad that exploring a different style of learning is a part of the course goals.
