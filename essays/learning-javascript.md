So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective? What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

__On Javascript__

I recently started learning java script and coming from C++ being my first language, there are a lot of things that are a welcomed change. I'm just going to list everything I like about the language so far.

1. Its a scripting language, so you can quickly do tests and experiments with it (in this case, from the Node.js environment).
2. Objects in Javascript more closely resemble key-value lists, rather than a C-like object with predefined fields and methods, so attributes can be added or removed at runtime as needed. This all works as expected because...
3. Functions as first class objects, so once you define a function, you can pass it around like any other variable (such as adding it to an object's list of attributes).
4. Arrays have no type restrictions, so there is less getting in the way of you making the kind of data structure you want to make.
5. Partial functions (function currying). Being able to partially apply a function's parameters (as well as nested functions) makes it easier to build larger and more flexible functions.
6. Javascript's loose typing makes it easy to build things on the fly, only when you need them, without having to first define some class or struct.
7. Lastly, generally every device has a web browser available. This makes it easy for Javascript projects to be built anywhere.

Overall, its just easier to more directly write what you want to make or happen in a way more closely resembling the way a human would think of it (and thus easier for other humans to work with), rather than having to deal with the details of how a computer is going to have to work with your data.
