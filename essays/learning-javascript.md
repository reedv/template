So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective? What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

__On Javascript__

good things: any scripting language is good for quick experimentation, functions are first class, objs are like key-value lists (which works as expected since functions are now first class) and can be changed at runtime (by adding or changing key/value pairs), arrays have no type restrictions (are more like generic lists). Overall, just easier to more directly write what you want to happen in a way more closely resembeling the way a human would think of it, rather than having to deal with the details how the computer is going to see your data.

I recently started learning java script and I'm just going to list everything I like about it so far.

1. Its a scripting language, so you can quickly do tests and experiments with it (in this case, from the Node.js environment).
2. Objects in Javascript more closely resemble key-value lists, rather than a C-like object, so fields and methods can be added or removed at runtime as needed. This all works as expected because...
3. Functions as first calss objects, so once you define a function, you can pass it around like any other variable (such as adding it to an objects list of attributes).
4. Arrays have no type restrictions, so there is less in the way of making the kind of data structure you want to make.
5. Partial functions (function currying). Being able to partially apply a function's parameters (as well as nested functions) makes it easier to build larger and more flexible functions.

Overall, its just easier to more directly write what you want to make or happen in a way more closely resembling the way a human would think of it (and thus easier for other humans to work with), rather than having to deal with the details of how a computer is going to have to work with your data.
