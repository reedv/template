Did you feel these past two weeks like you were hit on the head with “a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth’s atmosphere, becoming incandescent as a result of friction and appearing as a streak of light”?

If so, you’re probably not the only one. There is definitely an initial learning curve with Meteor. What did you find difficult? What did you find easy? What did you find cool and interesting?

Meteor is an example of a modern, internet-based, client-server application architecture. What are your first impressions of Meteor as an application architecture?

Coming from a background of not knowing many other application frameworks, I don't know that the learning curve of meteor is really worth much mention. Any new paradigm, framework, or language worth learning is usually not going to acquired easily and that's fine, especially for what you are getting in return; I know html and I know javascript and from the first Meteor demo app I was able to play around with, I could see that you were getting a lot of free behavior for the price of understanding a new application structure. You're getting a lot of seamless, dynamic behavior for not very much code at all. 

At the same time, the fact that you're not having to write very much code underlies the fact that there is a lot going on that is hidden below the surface creating this meteor magic that, when you need to interface with it, can make it difficult to understand and follow the trail of effects.

Again, not coming from a background of knowing a ton of frameworks, the big thing about meteor seems to be the ability to easily code real-time, collaborative apps which (from what I read) is usually really hard. If people with more experience than me are saying that meteor makes hard things manageable, I'm all for it.
