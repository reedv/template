__Disclaimer__: This essay was written for a college course to meet grading requirements, and while I am not particularly embarrassed of it, it does sound sound quite like _me_ and I hope to add more "essays" in the future.

When I was first learning programming, I had heard of git and GitHub, but was able to get by without thinking I really needed something like that. In later larger projects, working with teams of other people, though, using git/GitHub was a definite upgrade from the way I had been doing things before; I thought 'this is awesome, I should be using this for everything,' you can pull things down, break them in an isolated branch, and just was your hands of the mess you've made. Basically, git/GitHub helps better enable you to treat your project like a of box physical stuff that you and your team can sit around a table with and work on together. I think this is a much more natural way of thinking about working on code together and git/GitHub does a good job a letting you treat it that way.

Software configuration management (SCM) is the task of tracking and controlling changes in software. SCM includes revision control and the establishment of baselines.

SCM ensures that the current design and build state of the system is known, good, trusted; Importantly, it does not leave the code beholden to the implicit and unspoken knowledge of a particular development team. One of the main goals of SCM tools that I tend to make use of the most is  access to an accurate historical record of system state, which can be very useful and timesaving. Aside from project management and standardizing team interactions, having access to older versions of different components of a project allows you to do thing like check what has been changed in a new version from the previous, to look for reasons why your tests are no longer passing and even roll back to the previous working version fi this new one is flawed beyond repair (as opposed to having to manually rewrite the newer version to mirror the old).

I think that a lot of git's current popularity has to do with how well GitHub complements its usefulness. Going back the box-of-stuff-on-a-table analogy, git lets you take things from the table back to your desk, but GitHub is the table itself; GitHub also allows easy cloning and forking of projects, so I think GitHub's popularity benefits from the growth its hosted projects as well. GitHub also offers the ability to switch repositories between private and public, which gives private businesses and place to store code or take advantage of the open-source community. Finally, I think people just have a basic preference to work together to accomplish things. Overall, I think that the popularity of git comes from how well GitHub has made itself an effective place for the open-source community to interact.
