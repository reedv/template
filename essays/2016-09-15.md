“Configuration management” is a central software engineering skill. Without effective configuration management, it would be almost impossible for teams to build large and complex software systems and maintain them over time.

Git is currently the most popular technology for configuration management, and GitHub is currently the most popular cloud-based software hosting platform.

- What are your thoughts on configuration management? Have you ever had a problem due to the lack of effective configuration management practices?

- Do you think GitHub is popular because of git? Or do you think git is popular because of GitHub?

Software configuration management (SCM) is the task of tracking and controlling changes in software. SCM includes revision control and the establishment of baselines.

<NOTE: brief thoughts on good stuff about SMC that I use most>
SCM ensures that the current design and build state of the system is known, good, trusted; Importantly, it does not leave the code beholden to the implicit and unspoken knowledge of a particular development team. One of the main features of SCM is  access to an accurate historical record of system state, which can be very useful and timesaving. Aside from project management and standardizing team interactions, having access to older versions of different components of a project allows you to do thing like check what has been changed in a new version from the previous, to look for reasons why your tests are no longer passing and even roll back to the previous working version fi this new one is flawed beyond repair (as opposed to having to manually rewrite the newer version to mirror the old). These are just the parts of SCM that I tend to make use of the most.
