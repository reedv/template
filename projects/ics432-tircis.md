TIRCIS is a project at the Hawai`i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (UHM), which has developed a prototype of a hyperspectral thermal infrared imager for Earth surface, to be used in small satellites. It allows the quantifying of the chemical composition of targets (e.g., volcano plumes).

A 2014 abstract can be found [here] (https://esto.nasa.gov/forum/estf2014/presentations/B4P6_Wright.pdf)

This page is currently just a running list of some of the things I tried to optimize the code used to process hyperspectral data obtained from TIRCIS.
