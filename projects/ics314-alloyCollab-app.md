Alloy is a UH student-built tool to help members of the UH community find projects and find people for projects of their own. Have an idea for a project that would look good on your resume? Want to do your own custom senior project? Or do you just want experiment and learn something new with other students who just want to do the same? Alloy helps you find a team that's right for what you want.

Alloy is built using the Meteor web framework

My roles in the project:

1. skill grouping
	- flattened graph for efficiency
	
2. project recommendation
	- using edge weights and randomized display selection due to limited display space
	
3. initial implementation of dynamic content for ui elements
